    "### Why Map Reduce \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen the application of \"operators\", that\n",
    "is functions on functions, in particular, the reduce operator.\n",
    "We have seen how \"general\" they are in the sense that they\n",
    "identify a \"pattern\" of computation applicable to many scenarios,\n",
    "on different data types, on different functions. But why bother? \n",
    "Is it just for aestheticm or taste? Are there real world implications?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that map-reduce pattern is NOT ONLY general and applicable\n",
    "to many real world problems, it can also be run VERY FAST! In fact,\n",
    "the big data analysis industry with the Hadoop framework, was effectively\n",
    "born after Google \"redicovered\" map-reduce in the junk yard, and it is\n",
    "a multi-billion dollar industry TODAY. So What was the secret?\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, the stage is *embarrassingly parallel*, and can be calculated as fast\n",
    "as the the computational resources available;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, the reduce stage, due to the associativity of the function to be reduced, \n",
    "  we can manipulate the evaluation order, and use ONLY O(logN) parallel steps to evaluate all reduce computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a picture of how prefix scan is performed in parallel. You can see the upper half is really calculating the scan. Watch the number of steps, in relation to the size of the problem.\n",
    "The second half is like the upper going up-side down, to calculate the rest of the partial sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Parallelization](./Prefix_sum_16.svg.png \"Prefix Scan\")\n",
    "\n",
    "So as long as you could identify a map-reduce pattern, a whole data center can run\n",
